FrontEnd Mentor/Kevin Powell/Scrimba Challenge Project

This project is difficult for me so I am mostly following along with Kevin's Scrimba challenge, which is often difficult to follow because his images don't match up with what he is describing and that's really annoying for someone at my (lack) of skill level. I should probably try an easier challenge, but maybe I will learn more by challenging myself. 

Also, I'm not very good at .md Or git either for that matter.
